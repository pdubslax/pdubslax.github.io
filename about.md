Welcome to the blog! Here, you may find ramblings on a number of topics including cycling/triathlon, technology, music production, philosophy, sports, and more. I created this space to have an outlet to exchange thoughts, conversation, and learnings with the world and to encourage myself to continue creating.

Professionally, I'm a software engineer working in the trucking industry. I find my greatest strengths to be at the boundary of product and engineering and enjoy immersing myself in new problem spaces.
