## Koch Safari League Preview Watch Guide for Tonight

Another trip around the sun - and here we are. Our D's are in our hands, and it's finally week 1 of MNP. Since we've last gathered in this sacred space - some of us have been blessed with [beautiful families](https://i.imgur.com/Uv21LZP.png), some of us have dabbled in the [ancient practice of marriage](https://i.imgur.com/cDPq0gO.jpg), and still some... have [done this](https://i.imgur.com/Huh6G5Q.jpg). As we approach this inaugural kickoff, let us reflect back on the past year - recalling the ups the downs, and the times when you were already mathematically eliminated from contention before the MNP kickoff, with a broken handed QB and a DEEP regret for the time already invested in FF. For life is like a coin, you can spend it any way you wish, but most of the ways are liable to be highly visable and heavily critiqued by society/friends/family. To SEASON 3

### Matchups
**âœ…  Skylar (0-0) v Patrick (0-0)**

Bad things sometimes happen to good people. Bambi for example. Pat plays the rare perfect inverse lineup but it wouldn't have mattered. Skylar came hard and correct, and wrapped up a 40 point trouncing of the custodians of shloppy toppy - the robotrippin gardener.    

**99% Scott (0-0) v Diego (0-0)**

Scott heads into MNF clinging to a 62 pt lead, with Diego hoping Nick jacked up the defensive scoring enough for denver D to close the gap - or at least prevent him from becoming the "OHHHHHH YEA THATS GOOD - Burlap Bandicoot Ida Potato BIGGEST SACK OF THE WEEK" and suffering a devistating team name change - bringing an immesnse amount of shame to his family. 

**99% Keith (0-0) v Matt #1 (0-0)**

Matt experiencing PTSD from the ole days on this one, when Keith was just a little bit better at Call of Duty. Prestiged a little bit faster. Ate his Wendys with a little more gusto. Barring Juedy throwing it in reverse for 13 points, this one is OVER. 

Footnote: we had to let both our stastician and fact checker go - citing disordially office conduct, excessive horse play with questionable undertones - so Matt could have very well been the better @ CoD  

**97% Alex (0-0) v Matt #2 (0-0)**

Far too many players taking the field to type out in this matchup (3). But Matt #2 needs a christmas miracle, even more astounding than the conduct demonstrated in every other Elon Tweet. If Javonte Williams has a career night - Matt vows to bake his me-maw an apple pie every other fortnight, and to stop reading 50 shades of grey   

**89% Hy (0-0) v Jam (0-0)**

Doan enters the gladitorial arena as Maximus Decimus Meridius once did, down 12 but with a few weapons still up his sleve. Hoping for the Russ/Sutton connection to be looking like that Martha Stewart/Snoop Dog connection here to fend off Green Eggs and Jam.

**55% Nick (0-0) v Dan (0-0)**

Approximately 1116 pennys worth of points will be required for Dan to purchase a box of cracker jacks, and a victory over Nick's motely crew of football people. We still have little reason to presume that Dan has access to his account yet this season
