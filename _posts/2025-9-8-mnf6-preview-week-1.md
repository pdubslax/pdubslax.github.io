## Koch Safari League Preview Watch Guide for Tonight

The MNFP is like the Wall Street Journal. Highly respected in academic settings, far right leaning at times, and incredibly likely to die in the next few years. After dropping 5 of 14 weeks last season, its player readership is waiting with baited breath to learn if this season will be the beginning of the end. However, the loyal and worse at fantasy readers are not the only powers with a vested interest in the future of this publication - for I have it on good authority, that there are more than 2 bot farms hard at work defaming its fair name, praying on its downfall as we speak. One such message stated "Monday sure is a weak-day to publish a night football preview" which was just incredibly frustrating and demoralizing to read. Unfortunately for the haters - our dear author has recently come into a fair bit of mental unrest as a result of continuing to over schedule his life. And as Aristotle once said - "there was never a genius without a tincture of madness". So we tromp on - into the nothingness, it's another new chapter of the MNFP.
